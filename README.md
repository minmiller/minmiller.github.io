## Overview

### Links

Please refer to : [Author](#author)

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS 
- my soul & sanity 

### What I learned

- round corners (border-radius)
- pain of misusing/mixing up margin and padding 
- font-family linking/installation (forgot to add some requirements like font sizes over the link)
- many other stuff 
- also image folder over GitHub 


### Continued development

This was a very fun (& equally stressful) challenge to get started with building a portofolio. I'll continue to do some challenges with HTML & CSS on Frontend Mentor until I feel comfortable enough to code with little to no help (hopefully that'll happen). My goal is to either build a personal website or style a CSS Zen Garden page. I'll probably do the latter first since I really want to skill-up CSS stuff before moving onto JS.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank the strangers on the Internet, especially those on Stack Overflow and YouTube who rescued me from an endless abyss of technological difficulty.
